# ArduinoCarProject
This is our first attempt in building a bluetooth controlled car with Arduino. Once we get down all the parts we wanted to build it and test it. But there was a problem with our 3D Printed chassis. The Motors didn't want to work propertly, because the chasisis chains were to tight. So we didn't have enough time to find new chassis, that's why we decided to just make it work. For the power supply we used a 9V battery.
